                            <p class="content">School is a place were people come together with cool and creative projects ideas, but they don't have the possibility to work on them. For this a several separate room, where students have the possibilities to implement their ideas. There should be computers for digital art with graphic tablets, audio-production, maybe a 3D- Printer, with software to create models, furthermore there should be enough place to draw on normal paper and clay for creating figures. In those rooms there should be a calm and silent atmosphere, with plants, a couch and enough space for some people. It's also possible to have one big room and some small thinking tanks in there, which are isolated from the outside.  

                                Food and drinks are very important for creative work, so it would be great to place little vending machines all over the school with some small snacks and some drinks, so you have fast access to food, and you don't have to wait a long time in the cafeteria if you just want something small to drink. In the cafeteria you can buy normal food, like sandwiches, warm food etc. 
                                
                                To finance all of this, a sponsoring run is a possibility. In the 3th post you can find more about sponsoring runs.</p>

                            <p class="content">School should be a place where you can build social contacts and find new friends a good opportunity for this are some class trips together with other classes or some projects that you can build on with other students. Some examples for good projects are creating magazines, hosting party's, paint a mural, starting a vlog, creating a 3D model of the entire school for example or even designing an escape room could be a good idea for a big project in our school. As you see there are tons of ideas for school projects where the entire school can work on. 

                            A other opportunity for connecting social contacts is organizing some class trips where the whole grade or even the whole school can be a part of. Some good examples for that is a trip to a theme park, a cinema, a swimming pool, to another country, a soccer game etc. 
                               
                            It's definitely not as easy to organize as it may sound but if it would be at least once in a year, I think almost everyone would be happy about it.   
                               
                            In my opinion those two things are both great opportunity's to get to know new people and socialise with them, which is big part of the school life.</p>

                            <p class="content">There is a good way to improve teamwork in our school. For example, organize a fun tournament, one opportunity is riding bicycle. There will be a better teamwork between the students, to motivate their teammates and help when someone is struggling with his skills on his bicycle. The main goal of the tournament should be to have fun, not competitive winning but in the end a team can get the most points, for their teamwork and good performances. 

                                In addition, students can use events as a kind of sponsor race, to earn money for other projects, for example rooms for the students, class trips or other sport possibilities on the schoolyard, for example an additional soccer court, a mini golf place and basketball court. 
                                
                                Furthermore, to organize school parties, which are open for everyone, for special occasions, like Halloween, start of the holidays and at the half-year testimonies.  Students under 16 can also be a part of the party, but with restrictions. The organisation of the party improves the community and welds friendships between students. 
                                
                                In addition, people can meet there, dance together in groups and talk with each other. The music also connects people if they share the same passion, maybe the students share other interests.
                                
                                And the most important thing is that people get to know their perfect partner.</p>

                                Spending time with your friends at school is one of the most funniest things, so there should be enough space for that. As a solution for this, there should be a room, in which students can spend their time in breaks.

                                The room would replace the well-known "Auszeitraum". Inside this room, you could spend your break or your lesson, which felt out.

                                But why can't we spend our time in the cafeteria? - Of course you can spend your time in the cafeteria, but inside the new room you'd have possibilities to sit or lay on couches, listen to music or perhaps play some boardgames. This would also improve the social life between students in school.

                                Of course there would be behaviour rules, like leaving everything behind as it was before. This room would be the perfect opportunity for students, who want their silence.

                                Another thing our school need are more opportunities to sit on... There are way too less opportunities to seating outside. We need more benches and outdoor seats in our area, not everyone wants to stand outside in the breaks.
